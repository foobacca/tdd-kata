String Calculator
=================

A TDD kata that I'm doing over and over again.  I found it [here](http://www.peterprovost.org/blog/2012/05/02/kata-the-only-way-to-learn-tdd/).  From that page:

> ## The String Calculator Kata
> 
> Like the Bowling Kata, this kata, made popular by Roy Osherove, comes with a precise set of steps to follow. The essence is a method that given a delimited string, returns the sum of the values. I’ve always preferred my kata to define the tests I will follow every time through the exercise, so here are the tests I use for this one:
> 
> 1. An empty string returns zero
> 2. A single number returns the value
> 3. Two numbers, comma delimited, returns the sum
> 4. Two numbers, newline delimited, returns the sum
> 5. Three numbers, delimited either way, returns the sum
> 6. Negative numbers throw an exception
> 7. Numbers greater than 1000 are ignored
> 8. A single char delimiter can be defined on the first line (e.g. `//#` for a `#` as the delimiter)
> 9. A multi char delimiter can be defined on the first line (e.g. `//[###]` for `###` as the delimiter)
> 10. Many single or multi-char delimiters can be defined (each wrapped in square brackets)
> 
> I rarely bother with Test #10 when I do it, because it feels like a big step to take all at once, but Roy does include it in his definition, and I have it in my kata notebook.
